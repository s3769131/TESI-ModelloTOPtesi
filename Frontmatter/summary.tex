The classification of remote sensing images is a method of analysis and identification which allows to pair each pixel of a specific image with a label which corresponds to a specific class, letting a calculator to autonomously discriminate several regions which form the image itself.
Although there is a significant number of possible applications, this thesis will be focused on remote sensing techniques regarding VHRI, aimed to the Earth observation. \\
This thesis will explore the application of a modern feature extraction method, known as histograms of oriented gradients (HOG), applied to VHR multispectral images. \\
The algorithm, which has already been studied for what is concerned human detection, but is totally new for this field, will be deeply analyzed in each phase, highlighting how a difference parameter set corresponds to different performance changes. 
Even though some parameters combinations showed several differences when applied to different datasets, the overall result has been highly rewarding, especially referring in the almost total lack of previous work in this field.\\
Three relevant cases will be studied, regarding SPOT5 images acquired over Amiens (France). The imaged scenes represent a challenging classification problem, involving spacially homogenous classes (e.g. "water") as well as classes with an apparent geometrical structure (e.g. "built-up land") and textured land covers (e.g. the vegetated classes).\\
The experimental results will be discussed and turns out that the classification through the HOG implementation has several limits ragarding homogeneous regions. However, there were sharp increases in the zones charachterized by geometrical structures.
